# Fraud-Detection
Project Overview
This project aims to build a fraud detection model for a financial company to proactively identify fraudulent transactions. The dataset consists of 6,362,620 rows and 10 features. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning model development to detect fraudulent activities.

This project was developed as part of the Data Science & Machine Learning Internship Task by INSAID (International School of AI & Data Science).

Business Context
The primary goal is to:

Develop a predictive model to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

Identify key factors contributing to fraudulent activities.

Suggest actionable recommendations to prevent future fraud.

Project Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values and outliers.

Checked for multi-collinearity using VIF (Variance Inflation Factor).

Scaled numerical features where necessary.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed transaction patterns and visualized fraud distribution.

Identified significant trends differentiating fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions.
3. Feature Engineering
Selected important variables based on correlation analysis and feature importance methods.

Created derived features to improve model accuracy.

4. Model Development
Trained multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) and compared performance.

Selected the best-performing model based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

5. Key Insights
Highlighted factors strongly correlated with fraudulent activities.

Validated if these factors are practically explainable.

6. Recommendations
Suggested preventive measures for improving fraud detection infrastructure.

Proposed a methodology to evaluate effectiveness after implementation.


 Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost

### Fraud Prevention Strategy

1. **Real-Time Transaction Monitoring** â€“ Flag and hold suspicious high-value transactions for manual review.  
2. **Device Fingerprinting** â€“ Track and block transactions from unfamiliar or blacklisted devices.  
3. **Behavioral Analysis** â€“ Implement anomaly detection based on transaction patterns (amount, frequency, location).  
4. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** â€“ Require OTP or biometric authentication for high-risk transactions.  
5. **Continuous Model Updates** â€“ Retrain the fraud detection model periodically with new transaction data.

### Post-Implementation Validation

To evaluate whether these preventive measures are effective:

1. **A/B Testing** â€“ Split users into two groups (with and without the new fraud detection system) and compare fraud rates.  
2. **Fraud Rate Monitoring** â€“ Track the percentage of fraudulent transactions weekly; expect a downward trend.  
3. **False Positive Rate** â€“ Monitor legitimate transactions flagged as fraud; aim to keep false positives under 2-5%.  
4. **Customer Feedback** â€“ Collect feedback from customers about blocked transactions to ensure minimal inconvenience.  
5. **Periodic Model Evaluation** â€“ Use AUC, Precision-Recall, and F1-score every quarter to check if the model is still performing well.

Monitoring Strategy: Defined KPIs to check if implemented actions are effective.
